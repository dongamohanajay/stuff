What is difference between proxy and VPN?
Proxy and VPN defined. A VPN and a proxy are online services that hide your IP address by rerouting your internet traffic through a remote server. 
But a proxy works only with a single app or service, while a VPN secures all your internet traffic and encrypts it for extra security and privacy.
