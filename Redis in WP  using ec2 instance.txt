CONFIGURING REDIS TO WORDPRESS WHICH ARE IN DIFFERENT SERVERS:

Step 1 — Installing and Configuring Redis

sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl status redis

Step 2 — Testing Redis

redis-cli
In the prompt that follows, test connectivity with the ping command:
ping
Output must be like below
PONG
exit

Step 3 — open redis-config file and make chance given below

By default, Redis is only accessible from localhost.you need to update the configuration file to allow connections from anywhere.
To correct this, open the Redis configuration file for editing:
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
Locate this line and make sure it is uncommented (remove the # if it exists):
(bind 127.0.0.1 ::1) => (bind 0.0.0.0 ::1)
Scroll to the SECURITY section and look for a commented directive that reads:
# requirepass foobared (replace foobared with your password)
protected-mode no (by default it will be yes)
sudo systemctl restart redis.service

Step 4 install redis client in WP-server and add below lines in wp-config file

define('WP_REDIS_HOST', 'private IP');
define('WP_REDIS_PORT', '6379'); (allow custom port 6379 in security groups as well)
define('WP_REDIS_PASSWORD', 'MyPassword'); (optional)
