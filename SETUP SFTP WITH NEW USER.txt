SFTP (SECURE FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL) OR SSH FTP

Discription:
>>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a file protocol for transferring large files over the web
>> SFTP transfers files security using SSH and encrypted FTP commands to avoid password sniffing and exposing sensitive information in plain text.
>>SFTP can also be seen as an improvement over the FTPS, which is just an FTP protocol run over Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The major differences between FTP and SFTP are as follows âˆ’
 
FTP	                                                                                           SFTP
FTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol Secure.	                                 SFTP represents Secure File Transfer Protocol.
FTP establishes a connection via SSL/TLS.	                                         SFTPS establishes a connection via the SSH channel.
FTP will allow you to create custom commands.	                                         SFTP has better control of file permissions, ownership, and properties.
FTP supports EBCDIC transfers.	                                                         SFTP allows the creation of symbolic links
FTP allows the use of Trusted x.509 certificates.	                                 SFTP server only needed an individual port to be accessible on the firewall.


CREATE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SERVER
CONNECT TO PUTTY

Enter
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y


create new user in putty
Enter
adduser sai(any name)
usermod -aG sudo sai


Setting Up a Basic Firewall (the UFW firewall to make sure only connections to certain services are allowed)
Enter
ufw app list
(Output
Available applications:
  OpenSSH)
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable
ufw status
(Output
Status: active

OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6))


rsync --archive --chown=sammy:sammy ~/.ssh /home/sai


Creating a Directory for File Transfers

sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/uploads
sudo chown root:root /var/sftp
sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp
sudo chown sai:sai /var/sftp/uploads



Restricting Access to One Directory


sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

(Scroll to the very bottom of the file and add the following configuration snippet) copy and paste (check user name)

Match User sai
ForceCommand internal-sftp
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChrootDirectory /var/sftp
PermitTunnel no
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no

sudo systemctl restart sshd



Verifying the Configuration
connecting through cmd prompt or winscp(download)

ssh or sftp sai@your_server_ip
