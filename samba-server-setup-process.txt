Prerequisites
Installing Samba on Ubuntu
Configuring firewall
Configuring Global Samba Options
Creating Samba Users and Directory Structure
Creating Samba Users
Configuring Samba Shares
Connecting to a Samba Share from Linux
Using the smbclient client
Mounting the Samba share
Connecting to a Samba Share from Windows

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install samba
sudo systemctl status smbd
sudo ufw allow samba
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf
sudo mkdir /samba
sudo chgrp sambashare /samba
sudo useradd -M -d /samba/(folder name) -s /usr/sbin/nologin -G sambashare (username)
The useradd options have the following meanings:

-M -do not create the user’s home directory. We’ll manually create this directory.
-d /samba/josh - set the user’s home directory to /samba/josh.
-s /usr/sbin/nologin - disable shell access for this user.
-G sambashare - add the user to the sambashare group.

sudo mkdir /samba/(foldername)
sudo chown (username):sambashare /samba/(foldername)
sudo chmod 2770 /samba/(foldername)
sudo smbpasswd -a (username)
output:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
sudo smbpasswd -e (username)

To create another user repeat the same process .

Create the administrative user by typing:
Next, let’s create a user and group sadmin. All members of this group will have administrative permissions. Later if you want to grant administrative permissions to another user simply add that user to the sadmin group .
sudo useradd -M -d /samba/(foldername) -s /usr/sbin/nologin -G sambashare sadmin

The command above will also create a group sadmin and add the user to both sadmin and sambashare groups.

sudo smbpasswd -a sadmin
sudo smbpasswd -e sadmin
sudo mkdir /samba/(foldername)
sudo chown sadmin(user):sambashare(group) /samba/(foldername)
sudo chmod 2770 /samba/users
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

add the below script and make the required changes as per your users:

[users]
    path = /samba/users
    browseable = yes
    read only = no
    force create mode = 0660
    force directory mode = 2770
    valid users = @sambashare @sadmin

[josh]
    path = /samba/josh
    browseable = no
    read only = no
    force create mode = 0660
    force directory mode = 2770
    valid users = josh @sadmin

sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
sudo apt install smbclient
smbclient //samba_hostname_or_server_ip(private IP)/share_name(foldername) -U username
output:
Enter WORKGROUP\josh's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \>

sudo apt install cifs-utils
sudo mkdir /mnt/smbmount(foldername)
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=username //samba_hostname_or_server_ip/sharename(foldername) /mnt/smbmount

output:
Password for josh@//192.168.121.118/josh:  ********

sudo df -Th
sudo nano /etc/fstab/
sudo mount -a
sudo reboot

Connecting to a Samba Share from Windows
Windows users also have an option to connect to the Samba share from both command line and GUI. The steps below show how to access the share using the Windows File Explorer.

1.Open up File Explorer and in the left pane right-click on “This PC”.
2.Select “Choose a custom network location” and then click “Next”.
3.In “Internet or network address”, enter the address of the Samba share in the following format \\samba_hostname_or_server_ip\sharename.
4.Click “Next” and you will be prompted to enter the login credentials 
5.In the next window you can type a custom name for the network location. The default one will be picked up by the Samba server.
6.Click “Next” to move to the last screen of the connection setup wizard.
7.Click “Finish” and the files on the Samba server will be shown.
